Install and you should se a button in your upper-left corner that says "Yell Stuff!"

Clicking the button picks a quote randomly from the list inside the HelkRandomYell_quotes.lua file

You can click and drag the button to move it (position will be saved when you log out)

You can edit the HElkRandomYell_quotes.lua file with your own quotes - you can have as few or as many as you want

If you want to increase the odds of a certain quote being chosen, simply add it multiple times
