<h1>Updated for Midnight Prepatch (12.0.0.1)</h1>

After installing and launching the game you should see a small button on your screen that says <b>"Yell Stuff!"</b>
You can click and drag the button to position it to your liking

Clicking the button picks a quote randomly, initially from the defaults inside the <code>HelkRandomYell_quotes.lua</code> file
OR
After first launch, from the quote list saved in Account > [yourName] > SavedVariables > HelkRandomYell.lua

You can edit this <code>HelkRandomYell.lua</code> file in your SavedVariables folder to add your own quotes - you can have as few or as many as you want
Saving your current quote list in SavedVariables means that it won't be over-written by my defaults whenever I update the addon!
Next major update will include an in-game edit window so you can manage your quotes without having to edit the .lua file in SavedVariables

If you want to increase the odds of a certain quote being chosen, simply add it multiple times

You can also add <code>/click RandomYellButton</code> in any macro to say a random quote when you use a cooldown, for example - don't worry about spam, the button has a 1s cooldown built in to prevent this!
