<h1>Updated for Midnight Prepatch (12.0.0.0)</h1>

After installing and launching the game you should see a small button on your screen that says <b>"Yell Stuff!"</b>

Clicking the button picks a quote randomly from the list inside the <code>HelkRandomYell_quotes.lua</code> file

You can click and drag the button to move it (position will be saved when you log out)

You can edit the <code>HelkRandomYell_quotes.lua</code> file with your own quotes - you can have as few or as many as you want

If you want to increase the odds of a certain quote being chosen, simply add it multiple times

You can also add <code>/click RandomYellButton</code> in any macro to say a random quote when you use a cooldown, for example - don't worry about spam, the button has a 1s cooldown built in to prevent this!
